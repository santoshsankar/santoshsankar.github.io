I’m a Founding Partner of Dynamo Ventures. We invest in exceptional seed stage founders building startups in supply chain and mobility.

**I believe that people are the fundamental unit of any business.** It's people that build products, ramp go-to-market, and scale organizations that define industries and change markets.

Personally, I have a variety of interests including technology, design, and the outdoors. Additionally, I like to work out, cook, and root for Penn State football. I enjoy discussions around the intersection of design, technology, business, and the capital markets.

I live in Chattanooga, TN with my wife, son, and rambunctious golden retrievers.
